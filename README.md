This repository demonstrates a common PHP bug related to array key overwriting.  When using functions like `array_push()` or `array_merge()` with numeric keys, unexpected behavior can occur if the array already contains numeric keys. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The README explains the issue and provides solutions.
