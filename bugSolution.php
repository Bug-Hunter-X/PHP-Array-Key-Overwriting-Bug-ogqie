The solution involves being more mindful of array keys.  When adding elements, explicitly assign unique keys to avoid overwriting existing data.  For instance, using `array_push` with numeric arrays is less suitable; prefer using `[]` to append to ensure unique numeric keys are automatically generated. If you need to merge arrays, utilize `array_merge_recursive` for merging arrays with identical keys without losing data.
